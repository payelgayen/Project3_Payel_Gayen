I have used this footerclass to align the footer content appropriately in different pages.

Initially, I didn't specify any explicit css class to keep the footer at the bottom of the screen, by default "relative" position was used.
It worked perfectily in my previous project as in all the pages, there was long contents. However, in the users and schedule pages, content
was not long enough. So, footer appeared at the middle of the page. 

To adjust this, I added a css class to change the position from relative to absolute. but as the home page contains long contents,
therefore "absolute" was not appropriate there. So, there was a need to make it dynamic based on content length.
